## Project Description

### Overview

In order to practice data analysis and BI using Tableau, I've chosen created two Pokémon datasets by scraping two different pages (one of them using several URLs with ParseHub) to get complementary information to one I obtained using similar datasets in previous projects.

## Datasets
 
One is [Bulbapedia](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_base_stats_(Generation_VIII-present)) has an up-to-date list off all existing Pokémon with they're respective base stats. On the other hand from [2019 Pokémon World Championships](https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/worlds/2019/vgc-masters/), which cointains data of the top 4 for three different categories(in this case from 2019's Masters Divison but I also used URLs from 2014 to 2019 to all three exisiting divisions), I had to scrape data by looping over multiple URLs only 2019 data is easily attainable and clearly published in the web page but there's still active URLs back from 2014 to 2018.
